## Problem Agitation Section

**Are you still manually hunting for prospects on LinkedIn at 11 PM?**

🔥 **Spending 3+ hours daily** scrolling LinkedIn, copying emails into spreadsheets, and crafting individual messages

🔥 **Getting 2-3% response rates** from your cold outreach because you can't personalize at scale

🔥 **Missing follow-ups** and watching warm leads go cold because you can't track hundreds of conversations

🔥 **Sales team burning out** on repetitive prospecting tasks instead of closing deals

🔥 **Inconsistent pipeline** because your lead generation depends on someone having a "good prospecting day"

**This is costing you 20+ hours per week and thousands in missed revenue opportunities.**

Your competitors with automated systems are booking meetings while you're still building lists.

**Q: How is this different from hiring SDRs?**
