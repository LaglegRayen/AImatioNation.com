## Problem Agitation Section

**Are you still writing ad copy one painful word at a time?**

✏️ **Spending 4+ hours daily** brainstorming, writing, and revising ad copy for multiple clients and campaigns

✏️ **Running out of fresh angles** and recycling the same tired messaging that stops converting

✏️ **Bottleneck in campaign launches** because creative production can't keep up with media buying

✏️ **Clients demanding more variations** but you don't have bandwidth to A/B test properly

✏️ **Missing conversion opportunities** with generic landing pages that don't match ad messaging

✏️ **Team burning out** on repetitive creative tasks instead of strategic optimization

**This is costing you 20+ hours per week and limiting your agency's growth potential.**

While you're stuck in creative production, competitors with automated systems are launching more campaigns and stealing your clients.
