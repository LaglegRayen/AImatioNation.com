## Problem Agitation Section

**Are you burning cash on expensive team members for repetitive tasks?**

🤖 **Paying $60K+ annually** for SDRs who only work 8 hours a day with inconsistent performance

🤖 **Losing clients to slow response times** because your support team can't work weekends or late nights

🤖 **Project management chaos** with tasks falling through cracks and clients feeling ignored

🤖 **Scaling bottlenecks** because every growth spurt requires hiring and training expensive specialists

🤖 **Inconsistent client experience** depending on which team member handles the interaction

🤖 **High employee turnover** in repetitive roles, costing you thousands in recruitment and training

**This is costing you $150,000+ annually per role in salaries, benefits, and turnover costs.**

Your competitors with AI agents are providing 24/7 service at a fraction of your operating costs.
