## Problem Agitation Section

**Are you losing qualified prospects because you can't keep up with follow-ups?**

🎯 **Forgetting to follow up** with warm leads because you're juggling coaching calls, content creation, and admin work

🎯 **Manually scheduling calls** back-and-forth via email, looking unprofessional and wasting hours daily

🎯 **Losing track of client progress** across spreadsheets, notes, and memory - missing breakthrough moments

🎯 **No systematic onboarding** process, so new clients feel confused and overwhelmed

🎯 **Spending 10+ hours weekly** on administrative tasks instead of coaching and growing your business

🎯 **Inconsistent client experience** because everything depends on your availability and memory

**This is costing you 15+ hours per week and thousands in lost coaching revenue.**

Every unmanaged lead is potential revenue walking out the door to coaches with better systems.
