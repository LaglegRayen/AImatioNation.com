## Problem Agitation Section

**Are you still managing finances like it's the stone age?**

💰 **Manually entering invoices** and expenses into spreadsheets, wasting hours and making costly mistakes

💰 **Chasing receipts** and trying to remember what expenses were for weeks later

💰 **Month-end closing taking forever** because data is scattered across multiple systems

💰 **Missing cash flow issues** until it's too late because you don't have real-time visibility

💰 **Paying late fees** because invoice due dates fall through the cracks

💰 **Spending 15+ hours monthly** on bookkeeping that could be automated

💰 **Stressed about tax season** because your financial records are disorganized

**This is costing you $25,000+ annually in accounting fees, late penalties, and missed opportunities.**

Every hour spent on manual financial tasks is an hour stolen from growing your business and serving customers.
