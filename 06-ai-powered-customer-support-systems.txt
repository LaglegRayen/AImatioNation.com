## Problem Agitation Section

**Is your customer support team drowning in repetitive tickets?**

🎧 **Spending 70% of time** answering the same basic questions over and over again

🎧 **Frustrated customers waiting hours** for simple answers because your team is overwhelmed

🎧 **Support costs skyrocketing** as you hire more agents to handle growing ticket volume

🎧 **Inconsistent answers** depending on which agent handles the ticket and their knowledge level

🎧 **Late-night and weekend gaps** where customers get zero support for urgent issues

🎧 **Agent burnout** from repetitive work leading to high turnover and constant retraining

🎧 **Escalations going nowhere** because agents lack context from previous interactions

**This is costing you $150,000+ annually in support staff while damaging customer relationships.**

Every frustrated customer waiting hours for basic help is a potential churn risk and negative review.
