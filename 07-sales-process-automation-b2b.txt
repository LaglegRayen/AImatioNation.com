## Problem Agitation Section

**Is your B2B sales team still selling like it's 1995?**

📈 **Manually qualifying leads** and wasting time on prospects that will never buy

📈 **Inconsistent follow-up** because reps forget or get busy with other deals

📈 **Proposals taking weeks** to create, by which time prospects have gone cold

📈 **No visibility into pipeline** until deals suddenly disappear at the last minute

📈 **Reps spending 60% of time** on admin work instead of actually selling

📈 **Lost deals** due to poor handoffs between marketing, sales, and customer success

📈 **Inconsistent sales process** depending on which rep handles the prospect

**This is costing you 30-50% of potential revenue and burning out your best salespeople.**

Every day without automation is revenue walking out the door to competitors with smarter sales systems.
